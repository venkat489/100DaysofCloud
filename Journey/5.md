# Introduction

* External (Public) IP addresses are Internet addressable whcih means they can be fetched from outside.

* Internal (Private) IP addresses are internal to a corporate network.

* One cannot have two resources	with same public (External)	IP  address.

* However, two different corporate networks can have resources with same Internal
(private) IP address, as it is not available over the internet. These addresses are internal to some network.

* All VM instances are assigned at least one Internal IP address, creation of External IP addresses can be enabled for VM instances.

Note: When you stop an VM instance, External IP address is lost and a new one is made when we restart it.

# Static IP Address

When we stop and restart the VM instance its IP address (external) changes. To get a constant external IP address we have to assign a static IP address to the VM.

* On the search bar type external IP address.
* Then click on the IP address associate with your VM which you want to reserve.
* Then click on Reserve IP Address.
* Name the IP address.
* Choose the network tier version, Ip version and type(choose the same region as that of your VM).
* Click on Save.
* After it is created zoom out and see the change button.
* Click on Change and then in attach to section choose your VM instance.
* Now the newly created static IP address is attached to your VM.
* After assigning the ephemeral(it changes) external IP address is released(or deleted).
Note: IF you don't see your VM name then make sure the regions are same.

Now even if we stop the VM and restart it, its external IP address will not change.

Things to remember

* Static IP can be switched to another VM instance in same project
* Static IP remains attached even if you stop the instance. You have to  manually detach it.
*  You are billed for an Static IP when you are not using it!
   Make sure that you explicitly release an Static IP when you are not using it. The bill for not using it is much more than the bill you pay when you use it.
