After creating your VM instance SSH into it and write the following commands:-

* Before starting anything first you've to become a route user

```bash
 sudo su
```
* Update all packages present in the VM

```bash
 apt update
```
* Now after updating the package index the next step is to install Apache, Apache is the http server that we would want to run on the virtual machine.

```bash
 apt install apache2
```
Press 'Y' after it asks to continue

Click on the external IP to look for the page behind the apache server installed.

* Instead of this page, we can customised our own page by

```bash
 ls /var/www/html
```
* Print command (to show on the SSH console) 

```bash
 echo "Hello World!"
```
* To write anything in the index.html 

```bash
 echo "Hello World!" > /var/www/html/index.html
```
Now reload the external IP page (or click on the external IP again) you can see Hello World printed on the page.

* To print hostname (name of your VM instance)

```bash
 echo $(hostname)
```
* To print ip address (internal) of your VM instance

```bash
 echo $(hostname -i)
```
* To print hello from this hostname

```bash
 echo "Hello World from $(hostname)"
```
* To print hello from this hostname along with IP address

```bash
 echo "Hello World from $(hostname)  $(hostname -i)"
```
* To pipe the above message to index.html

```bash
 echo "Hello World from $(hostname)  $(hostname -i)" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

Now reload the external IP address page and see the message displayed. 

# Troubleshooting

If you have trouble launching the URL page then check
* If you are using the right URL (external IP)
* If you are hitting the right URL then SSH into it.

If you are able to SSH into it then check if your apache web server is properly installed

* Run the below command

```bash
 ls /var/www/html
```
* If you see an index.html file then see the contents present in it

```bash
 cat /var/www/html/index.html
```
* Also make sure apache web server is started up fine

```bash
 sudo su
 service apache2 start
```

* And now again hit the external IP to check if the URL is now working.

* If the URL is still not working then click on the VM instance name and scroll down to check the if HTTP is clicked on in the firewall section.
