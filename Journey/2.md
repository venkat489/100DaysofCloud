# Introduction
Google Cloud Platform is a cloud service provider like Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS etc. The main services provided by GCP are:-
* Compute
* Storage
* Big Data
* Machine Learning

GCP offers more than 200+ services and is one of the best 3 service providers in the market.

It is reliable, secure and highly performant:
Its infrastructure powers 8 services with over 1 Billion Users: Gmail,  Google Search, YouTube etc. and is also the "cleanest cloud"  i.e. Google has been 100% carbon neutral (since 2007) as it uses renewable energy.

Before practising on the real console quick tour of the GCP console is necessary; for that one can refer to Qwiklabs and start practising from scratch 

Here is the link for the introductory lab on Qwiklabs. -> [A tour of Google Cloud](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/2794?parent=catalog)

Note: Before starting one needs to sign in and read the manual carefully.

# IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service

It provides only a base infrastructure (Virtual machine, Software Define Network, Storage attached). End user have to configure and manage platform and environment, deploy applications on it. Paas offerings binds application code ureyou write to libraries that give access to the infrastructure your application needs that way one has to focus on the application logic only. In this one only pays for what they allocate.

AWS (EC2), GCP (CE), Microsoft Azure (VM) are examples of Iaas.

# PaaS - Platform as a Service

It provides a platform allowing end user to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure. In this one has to pay for what they use.

Google App Engine, CloudFoundry, Heroku, AWS (Beanstalk) are some examples of PaaS.

# SaaS - Software as a Service
It is sometimes called to as “on-demand software”. Typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser. In SaaS everything can be managed by vendors: applications, runtime, data, middleware, OSes, virtualization, servers, storage and networking, End users have to use it.

GMAIL is Best example of SaaS. Google team managing everything just we have to use the application through any client or in the browser. examples SAP, Salesforce.

A Zone is a deployment area for GCP resources. A zone doesn't correspond to a single physical building(not like a GCP data centre) Zones are grouped into regions, independent geographic locations. All the zones within a region have fast network connectivity among them. A lot of GCP customers run their resources in different regions too, to bring their applications closer to their users around the world and also to protect against the loss of an entire region (in case of a natural disaster)

Advantages:-
* High Availability - In case a region is lost due to any circumstances the same data can be retrieved from different data centres, that's why there are multiple regions.
* Low Latency - Users can be served from the nearest region.
* Global footprint - A startup in India might be able to easily deploy applications to multiple parts of the world and therefore it can create global applications.
