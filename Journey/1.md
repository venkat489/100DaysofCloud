# Introduction
The term cloud refers to a network or the internet. It is a technology that uses remote servers on the internet to store, manage, and access data online rather than local drives. The data can be anything such as files, images, documents, audio, video, and more.


Cloud computing is a virtualization-based technology that allows us to create, configure, and customize applications via an internet connection. The cloud technology includes a development platform, hard disk, software application, and database.

OR

Cloud Computing is a way of using IT that has these equally important traits:-
* On-demand self-service
* Broad network access
* Resource pooling
* Rapid elasticity
* Measured services

For example, we have an online shopping app the challenges faced are:- 
* Peak usage during holidays and weekends.
* Less load during the rest of the time.

The solution offered before the cloud was:-
* Peak Load provisioning: Procure (Buy) infrastructure for peak load ( What would the infrastructure be doing during periods of low loads? ).

Another example, is we have a startup, the challenges faced are:-
* Startup suddenly becomes popular.
* How to handle the sudden increase in load?

The major challenges faced by firms before the cloud were:-
* High cost of procuring infrastructure.
* Needs ahead-of-time planning (Can you guess the future?)
* Low infrastructure utilization (PEAK LOAD provisioning)
* Dedicated infrastructure maintenance team (Can a startup afford it?)

  
All of the above-faced challenges can be solved with the help of cloud
* As it provides on-demand resource provisioning, we can access the resources using a simple interface without human intervention as per our requirements for eg. we can get processing power of storage and network.
* Provides elasticity, if we need more resources we can get them rapidly, if we want less then we can scale back.
* We don't have to guess the capacity before setting up the environment, we can adjust that as per the usage with time.
* Resources can be accessed from anywhere anytime, we don't have to spend money on running and maintaining data centres.
*  Go global in minutes.
*  The customers only have to pay for the services they've used or reserved as they go. If they stop using resources they stop paying from that very moment.
*  High security of data.
*  Backups available incase of data loss.

There are many cloud service providers in the market like Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud etc. For this 100 Days Cloud Challenge I'll be focusing on GCP first and then explore other cloud services.
