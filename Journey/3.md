# Introduction

In corporate data centers, applications are deployed to physical servers. But in cloud the physical servers are rented known as Virtual Machines. So Google Compute Engine is the service in Google Cloud platform to provision and manage your virtual machines.

# Features

* Create and manage lifecycle of Virtual Machine (VM) instances (start, stop and terminate)
* Load balancing and auto scaling for multiple VM instances  
* Attach storage (& network storage) to your VM instances
* Manage network connectivity and configuration for your VM instances

# Create your first Virtual Machine

* Open GCP console and search Compute Engine in search bar.
* Click on create VM instance.
* Give your VM instance a name.
* Choose region and zone where you want to deploy your virtual machine or choose default.
* Choose the Machine Family (hardware) as per your use or choose default.
* Choose Boot Disk (operating system) or choose default.
* On the firewall section, click HTTP/HTTPs traffic 
* Optional - add labels, indicating more information about the VM for eg. dev environment.
* Click create and wait for 3-4 mins.

Here's a link to create your first VM on Qwiklabs - > [Create a Virtual Machine ](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/3563?parent=catalog)

# Compute Engine Machnine Family

When we create VM instance it asks for the machine family (hardware on which we want to deploy). There are different types of machine family for different workloads.
* General Purpose (E2, N2, N2D, N1) : Best price-performance ratio

    Web and application servers, Small-medium databases, Dev environments

* Memory Optimized (M2, M1): Ultra high memory workloads

    Large in-memory databases and In-memory analytics

* Compute Optimized (C2): Compute intensive workloads

    Gaming applications

For example lets consider E2

Here, 
* e2 - Machine Type Family
* standard - Type of workload
* 2 - Number of CPUs

Note: Memory, disk and networking capabilities increase along with vCPUs

# Compute Engine Images 

After choosing the machine family (hardware) we have to choose the operating system of our instance.
That's what we decide by choosing the images.

Type of Images:
* Public Images: Provided & maintained by Google or Open source communities or third party
vendors
* Custom Images: Created by you for your projects
