We can reduce number of steps in creating a VM instance and settinh up Http server by:-
* Using Startup Script
* Creating Instance Template
* Creating Custom Image

# Bootstrapping  VM with Startup script

Bootstrapping is the process to install OS patches or software when a VM instance is launched. 

Whenever we are launching up a virtual machine we want to be sure that it is secure and ensure that all the OS patches including the latest ones, are also applied, we do this by using a startup script.

In the virtual machine we can configure a startup script to bootstrap by the following steps:-

* Open the GCP console.
* Follow the same steps required to create a VM instance.
* Allow http traffic in firewall section.
* To add startup script click on the Management, security,disks, networking, sole tenancy option highlighted in blue colour below firwall.
* It will open few tabs but in management one can see Startup script.
* As per the requirement one can add the startup script (here we have to install http web server)
* Add the commands in the startup script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash  apt update
apt -y install apache2
echo "Hello world from $(hostname) $(hostname -I)" > /var/www/html/index.html
```
* Click on Save.
* To check if your http web server is installed click on the external ip address and see your Hello world message displayed on the screen.

# VM creation with Instance Template

Whenever we create an instance we have to specify all the details again (like hardware, image instance, type, startup script)


To avoid that we create an instance template, define the machine type, the image, labels, startup script and a lot of other properties related to the virtual machine, and one can use that template to launch your virtual machines thereafter.

Instance Templates are used to create VM instances and managed instance groups.(Provides a convenient way to create similar instances)

Note: Once created it cannot be updated (To make a change, copy an existing template and modify it
)

Steps to create Instance Template:-

* On the GCP console search bar type Instance template.

* Choose the machine family, images, firewall, and add the startup script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash  apt update
apt -y install apache2
echo "Hello world from $(hostname) $(hostname -I)" > /var/www/html/index.html
```
* Click on create.
* Click on the three dors and select create VM.

One can see all the specifications have already been selected.

* Choose the region and zone and click on create.

* To check if your http web server is installed click on the external ip address and see your Hello world message displayed on the screen.
