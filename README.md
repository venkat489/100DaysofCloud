# Astha's Cloud Journey

Greetings everyone! My name is Astha, and I am a passionate and aspiring cloud enthusiast. The concept of the 100 Days of Cloud challenge immediately captivated me, as it offers an incredible opportunity to immerse myself in the vast and ever-evolving world of cloud computing.

Throughout this journey, my primary goal is to deepen my knowledge and proficiency in cloud computing concepts. I plan to focus on the Google Cloud Platform to better understand its features, capabilities, and best practices.

I have devised a structured learning plan to make the most of this challenge. I will dedicate much of my time to studying essential cloud concepts with hands-on practice through Qwiklabs challenges. I've also done a Coursera specialisation course on Architecting with Google Compute Engine.

At the end of this challenge, I'd like to:
* Have a comprehensive understanding of cloud technologies,
* Be confident to work on a real cloud console.
* Build projects
* Learn Shell
